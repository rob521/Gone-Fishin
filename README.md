# Gone-Fishin

This is the all the code for a robot that plays "lets go fishing". We made this robot for a applied robotics class at OSU

Full robot details can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/appliedroboticsteamssn

Note: We had to modify the code so that it doesn't use the camera thus the image processing code is not needed.
